# Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

## Context

When I was initially learning to code, Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm was one of the first algorithms I wrote, and I wrote it badly!
This repo was created to document the initial state of the code as well as to (hopefully) document my improvements as I learn. 

### Usage

```./bin.out <path/to/input.txt> ```

The input file should be of the form: 
- list of nodes, separated by ```\n```
- new line
- list of edges, as: node1, node2, distance
- new line
- list of paths to find as: startNode, endNode
